<h4>Homework:</h4>

1. Expand smoke test coverage with microservice availability tests - `/status` endpoint 
2. Use fastapi-pagination library for basic pagination in endpoints that return a list of objects
3. Add pagination tests. There should be enough test data to check pagination (at least 10)
   1. expected number of objects in the response
   2. correct number of pages for different size values
   3. different data is returned for different page values
